#+TITLE: Introduction to Linear Algebra

Strategy

- Why caring about Linear Algebra? [mainly speak about application first, then
  speed up]. Main Applications: machine learning/statistics, avoid for loops,
  visions [with convolution], graphics, simulations [markov chains, graphs
  algorithms].

- What is Linear Algebra? Start with example of geometry [vector/planes], then
  speak about linear transformation as mappings/functions [speak about
  projection, bijectivity], Transition to matrix showing a one to one
  relationship between function to matrices. Make the case of composition of
  mapping is multiplication of matrices?

- Start making example with scaling and rotation, extend to translate.

- Linear Algebra in Clojure: speak about Neanderthal API and link to numpy?
